<a name="projmo"/>

## Project Motivation
This is a Udacity project that is intended to test my abilities as a data scientist and how I would perform with a real world task, for that I chose to work with Airbnb Seattle data, and answer the following questions:
1. What is the relationship between listing availability and price across the year?
2. How does the top 500 earners compare to the lower 500?
3. For the top 25 reviewers what is the average number of characters they use in their reviews?
